This WordPress plugin demonstrates how to setup a plugin that uses React and ES6 in a WordPress plugin.

== Description ==

A complete plugin generated by [create-wp-react-app](https://github.com/matzeeable/create-wp-react-app) and the boilerplate [wp-reactjs-starter](https://github.com/matzeeable/wp-reactjs-starter). It comes with a complete local development environment and the newest technologies to build your WordPress plugin: ES6, TypeScript, Docker, GitLab CI, ... Note: This plugin has no functionality, it simply demonstrates how the plugin gets deployed to wordpress.org plugin directory when using the starter plugin.

**Client-side features:** _Familiar React API & patterns (ES6) with TypeScript_
