# This file defines all needed services for the local development environment without any host-specific options like "ports" .
#
# docker-compose.e2e.yml:
#   This file gets used when running E2E tests in CI in GitLab, it also should not export any "ports".
# docker-compose.traefik.yml:
#   This file is used for review applications which are managed on the same server as gitlab-runner and traefik.
#   It's the same like E2E but this containers are stopped when the GitLab environments emits to stop
# docker-compose.local.yml
#   This file is used for local development and there you should for example expose "ports".
#
# If you add any service please also adjust the docker-compose.e2e.yml and docker-compose.traefik.yml.
